# NLNOG Looking Glass
This is the NLNOG Looking Glass for OpenBGPD, written by Teun Vink. This code is used as a front end to the <a href="https://openbgpd.org">OpenBGPD</a> route collector operated by NLNOG. The looking glass is hosted at https://lg.ring.nlnog.net. The code was inspired on [bird-lg](https://github.com/sileht/bird-lg/) by Mehdi Abaakouk.

**Please note**: this code is not intended as general purpose looking glass code. It is custom made for this specific use case.

Questions about the status of the Looking Glass or its peers should be directed at ring-admins@nlnog.net.

## Known communities
Where possible the Looking Glass tries to provide information on communities used on routes. We provide two ways of defining communities for an ASN:

### draft-ietf-grow-yang-bgp-communities ###
[draft-ietf-grow-yang-bgp-communities](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-grow-yang-bgp-communities/) was designed to describe BGP communities for an ASN in a formalised way which can be generated and parsed automatically. The NLNOG Looking Glass supports retrieving a file in this format from a specified URL and using it as a data source for a given ASN. The list of URLs used by the Looking Glass can be found in [community_urls.yml](community_urls.yml).

### community description files ###
At the beginning of this looking glass we loosely defined a file format to describe communities for an ASN in a text file format. Although draft-ietf-grow-yang-bgp-communities style descriptions should be preferred, we continue to support these.

Files of this type are stored in the [`communities`](communities) folder. This folder contains a file per ASN for known communities. Each line should contain a community entry followed by a comma, followed by the description of the community. Any line not matching this format is ignored.

The following types of entries are accepted for communities:
* **exact matches**, for example: `65535:666`, only matching this exact community
* **ranges**, for example: `65535:0-100`, matching anything from `65535:0` upto `65535:100`
* **single digit wildcards**, for example: `65535:x0`, matching for `65535:00`, `65535:10`, `65535:20`, etc
* **any number**, for example: `65535:nnn`, which matches any community staring with `65535:` followed by any number.

**Large communities** are supported as well. They can be formatted similar to regular communities, only contain three parts separated by semicolons. For example: `65535:0:12345`, `65535:nnn:0`, `65535:123:100x`.

**Extended communities** can be specified by the `label number` or `label number:number` notation, using the same wildcard options. For example: `soo 65535:0`, `soo 65535:nnn`.

When using wildcards, wildcard values can be replaced in the description by referencing them by number. For example:
```
65535:0:nnn,do not announce to AS$0
65535:x:nnn,prepend $0 times to AS$1
```

Additions and updates to the list of communities are welcome, if possible please provide a source for the data as a comment on the first line of the file, and name the file `asNNN.txt`, where `NNN` is the ASN.
