<h2>
About the NLNOG Looking Glass
</h2>
This Looking Glass is hosted by <a href="https://nlnog.net">NLNOG</a>, The Dutch Network Operators Group. The Looking Glass runs <a href="http://openbgpd.org/">OpenBGPD</a> as backend and a custom made front end written by Teun Vink,
for which the source code can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/NLNOG/lg.ring.nlnog.net">on GitHub</a>. The code was inspired on <a href="https://github.com/sileht/bird-lg/">bird-lg</a> by Mehdi Abaakouk.
</p>
<p>
The Looking Glass is managed by the NLNOG RING Administrators which can be reached at <a href=""mailto:ring-admins@nlnog.net">ring-admins@nlnog.net</a>.
You can contact them for questions, reporting issues or setting up new BGP sessions with the Looking Glass server.

<h3>Known BGP Communities</h3>
<p>
This Looking Glass uses a collection of known BGP communities to provide additional information on routes received. We offer two ways of defining communities for an ASN:
<ul>
    <li>host a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-grow-yang-bgp-communities/">draft-ietf-grow-yang-bgp-communities</a> style file describing the communities for an ASN</li>
    <li>provide a file with our (older) way of describing communities for an ASN</li>
</ul>
The current list of URLs we query for draft-iets-grow-yang-bgp-communities style communitiy descriptions can be found in <a href="https://github.com/NLNOG/lg.ring.nlnog.net/blob/main/community_urls.yml">community_urls.yml</a>. A list of ASNs for which old style community definities are available can be found <a href="https://github.com/NLNOG/lg.ring.nlnog.net/tree/main/communities">here</a>.</p>
<p>New community descriptions and updates can be added sending a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/NLNOG/lg.ring.nlnog.net/">Github repostory</a>, which also provides information on the file format. For any questions, feel free to contact the <a href=""mailto:ring-admins@nlnog.net">ring-admins@nlnog.net</a>.
